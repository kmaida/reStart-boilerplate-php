reStart-boilerplate-php
=======================

A responsive, mobile-first, front-end boilerplate, leveraged with PHP.

This was built because nearly every site or application I have created in the last 6 months has utilized the features listed below. Tired of copying and pasting from my previous sites, I wrote this boilerplate from the ground-up.

##Features

* HTML5 doctype / PHP
* Conditional HTML classes for IE7-9
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) (version 2.6.2 - recommend you create your own custom build or download from [GitHub](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr))
* [Mobile First](http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp) / [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)
	* Off-canvas Navigation (using transitions and 3D transforms with fallbacks)
	* [jRespond](https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond) (for implementation of breakpoint-specific functionality - recommend you download the latest version from ten1seven's GitHub repo)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) (version 1.x - recommend you download the version you need / upgrade to 2.x if not supporting older browsers)
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) tracking snippet (fill in your ID)
* CSS 
	* reset / normalize / basic re-usable classes
	* off-canvas styles
	* only most basic styles; "add, not delete"
* Large screen and print media queries

##Requirements

Apache/PHP, but the files can easily be adapted to HTML-only if desired.
